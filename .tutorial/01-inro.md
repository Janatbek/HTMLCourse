# Welcome to the world of HTML elements!

HTML elements are like 🏗️ building blocks 🏗️ that make up a web page. Each block has a beginning and an end, and they're called opening and closing tags.

Opening tags are like the 🎉 start of a party 🎉. They tell the browser where to start applying a specific formatting to the content, like a `<h1>` tag for a heading or an `<img>` tag for an image. Opening tags are surrounded by angle brackets, like this: `<p>`

Closing tags are like the 💔 end of a relationship 💔. They tell the browser where to stop applying that formatting to the content. Closing tags are similar to opening tags, but with a forward slash (/) inside the angle brackets to indicate that it's the closing tag, like this: `</p>`

For example, to create a paragraph with the text "Hello, world!", you would use an opening and closing tag like this:

```
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
```
This tells the browser to display the text "Hello, world!" as a paragraph.
In this chapter, you'll learn about some of the most common HTML elements and how to use them. 🤓

Let's get started with some examples:

Use the `<h1>` tag to create a main heading for your page. 📌
```
<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
```
Use the `<p>` tag to write a paragraph about your favorite animal. 🐶
```
<p>I love dogs. They're the best!</p>
```
To create an unordered list of your top three favorite foods use the `<ul>` and `<li>` tags. 🍔🍕🍟
```
<ul>
  <li>Burgers</li>
  <li>Pizza</li>
  <li>Fries</li>
</ul>
```
Use the `<a>` tag to create a link to your favorite website. 🌐
```
<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
```
